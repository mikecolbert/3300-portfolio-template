        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 2, 2025</p>

        <section>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes how this website (the “Site”) operated by 
                <strong>[Your Name]</strong> (“I”, “me”, or “my”) collects, uses, and protects information. 
                This Site is a personal portfolio and is intended to showcase my work and professional background.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using this Site, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Information I Do Not Intentionally Collect</h2>
            <p>
                This Site does <strong>not</strong> have user accounts, comment sections, or forms that allow you to submit information directly.
                I do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, or phone number) through the Site itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you choose to contact me directly (for example, by email or through social media), I will receive the information you choose to share, 
                and I will use it only for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or continuing our conversation.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Analytics and Usage Data</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Google Analytics</h3>
            <p>
                This Site uses <strong>Google Analytics</strong>, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC (“Google”), to help me understand how visitors use the Site.
                Google Analytics collects information such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pages you visit and how long you stay on them</li>
                <li>Your browser type and operating system</li>
                <li>Approximate geographic location (country/city level)</li>
                <li>Referring website or link (how you arrived at this Site)</li>
                <li>Other usage data related to your interaction with the Site</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Google may also collect your IP address. Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze this information 
                and to generate reports on Site activity. The data collected through Google Analytics is aggregated and does not directly identify you personally.
            </p>
            <p>
                For more information on how Google uses data from sites that use its services, please see Google’s policies:
                <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                    https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
                </a>.
            </p>

            <h3>2.2 How I Use Analytics Data</h3>
            <p>
                I use the information provided by Google Analytics to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand how many people visit the Site</li>
                <li>See which pages are most interesting or helpful</li>
                <li>Improve the content, layout, and overall experience of the Site</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
            <p>
                Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a website. This Site itself does not set cookies for user accounts,
                logins, or personalization. However, <strong>Google Analytics uses cookies</strong> to collect usage data as described above.
            </p>
            <h3>3.1 Managing Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                You can control or disable cookies through your browser settings. The process varies by browser, but typically you can:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>View which cookies are stored on your device</li>
                <li>Delete existing cookies</li>
                <li>Block cookies from specific sites or all sites</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Please note that disabling cookies may affect how some websites function, though this Site should remain largely usable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Google also provides an opt-out browser add-on for Google Analytics, available at:
                <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                    https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
                </a>.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing (Visitors from the EEA/UK)</h2>
            <p>
                If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, my legal basis for collecting and using 
                analytics information described above is my <strong>legitimate interest</strong> in understanding how the Site is used 
                and improving its content and functionality.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
                Analytics data collected via Google Analytics is retained in accordance with the settings in my Google Analytics account.
                Data is kept only for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this policy and to comply with applicable laws.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Third-Party Links</h2>
            <p>
                This Site may contain links to third-party websites (for example, links to my projects, social media profiles, or external resources).
                I am not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those third-party sites. I encourage you to review the privacy policies
                of any external websites you visit.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                This Site is not directed to children under the age of 13, and I do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
                If you believe that a child has provided me with personal information, please contact me so that I can delete it.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Security</h2>
            <p>
                I take reasonable steps to protect the information collected through this Site from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access.
                However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, 
                so I cannot guarantee absolute security.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
                I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the Site, the tools I use, or legal requirements.
                When I do, I will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Site after any changes 
                constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
